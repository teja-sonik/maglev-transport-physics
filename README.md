# Magnetic Levitation Transportation: Mathematical Analysis & Review

*A 2017 physics report polished, error-corrected, and digitized for showcase*

## Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive mathematical analysis of magnetic levitation transportation systems that I originally wrote in 2017. Looking to dust off and stretch my mathematical foundations after years focused on applied work, I've revisited this analysis to :

- **Identify and correct mathematical errors** via detailed review
- **Reconstruct the complete LaTeX source** from the original PDF
- **Document my learning process** of applying mathematical scrutiny to past work
- **Demonstrate analytical thinking** relevant to quantitative roles

## What's Inside

The original report covers:
- **Electromagnetic levitation theory** (EMS vs EDS systems)
- **Vector calculus applications** (Biot-Savart-Law\BSL, magnetic field calculations)  
- **Differential equations** for motion and energy
- **Earnshaw's Theorem** and stability analysis
- **Linear motor physics** and propulsion systems

## Key Mathematical Corrections

*Review WIP*

## Background Context

Written as part of my AP Physics C high school final project (2017), this report demonstrates early mathematical sophistication with:
- Graduate-level electromagnetic theory
- Advanced calculus applications  
- Engineering physics concepts
- Independent research
